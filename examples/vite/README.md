# Vite

This directory is a brief example of a Vite/Vue.js site that can be deployed to Youappz with zero configuration.

While this project uses Vue.js, Vite supports many popular JS frameworks. [See all the supported frameworks](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Vite project with Youappz.
