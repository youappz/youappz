# Youappz Examples

To get started using any of these examples as your own project, [install Youappz](https://youappz.com/cli) and use either of the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
appz init                    # Pick an example in the CLI
appz init <example>          # Create a new project from a specific <example>
appz init <example> <name>   # Create a new project from a specific <example> with a different folder <name>
```

Deploying your project can be done with **a single command**:

```appz
appz                         # Deploy your project with the CLI
```

With the `appz` command, your project will be built and served by Youappz, providing you with a URL that can be shared immediately.
